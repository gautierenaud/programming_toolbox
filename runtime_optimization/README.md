# Runtime optimization

This is a small project to illustrate myself the content of:
* [inline caching](https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/inline-caching/)
* [inline caching: quickening](https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/inline-caching-quickening/)
* [small object and pointer tagging](https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/small-objects/)

Which are a series of blog entry that ellaborate on a specific aspect of runtime optimization.

In his blog, the author illustrates his example with an implementation (C or C++), and I will try to do the same in this project. While I'm at it I'll do it in Golang.
