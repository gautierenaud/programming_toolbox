# Fastbin

This exploit seems to use how fastbin works, by exploiting how it writes addresses in the freed memory chunks.

When freed, the memory chunks will have an address of the next chunk (in a linked list manner). The exploit is about overwriting one such address (e.g. with an use after free) so we can write somewhere else.

In the example that was presented, the address has been overwritten with an address from the stack.

BTW, to use the example:
```bash
gcc -g -o fastbin fastbin.c
./fastbin
```

What made me happy was the fact that it seems to work with my local libc (2.31). What makes me less happy is the realisation that it have not worked with fastbins, but with tcache instead (but I'm still happy to see it working ^^).

Since tcache seems to have a behavior similar to the one described in the fastbin example, I hope the lesson isn't lost on me.
