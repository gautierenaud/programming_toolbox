# Unlink

Unlink is an attack where one fakes a chunk to which he has a global pointer, then frees it to have a pointer to fd (?). To do so we have to
* forge pointers to emulate a link of a linked list
* set metadata's sizes to take in account the size of the fake chunk we are creating
* set fd_nextsize to 0x0 to disable several checks

The `free` will then unlink the fake chunk, and a pointer to the fd pointer.

This exploit seems to work with older versions of libc, up to 2.26.
