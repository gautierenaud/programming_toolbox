# Programming Toolbox

Initially, this was a repo to have fun with Donald Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming" book (mainly implement some toy examples). Then it expanded into a registry of several learning projects, which list can be seen below.

Done:
* Implement algo from Knuth's book
* Explore padding
* Explore instruction vectorization
* Explore cache miss
* Explore binaries: https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/
* [linux from scratch](https://linuxfromscratch.org/)

Ideas list:
* take course for [performance](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-172-performance-engineering-of-software-systems-fall-2018/lecture-videos/index.htm)
* read [this (about memory)](https://lwn.net/Articles/250967/) and take notes
* [inline caching](https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/inline-caching-quickening/)
* learn better [vim](https://thevaluable.dev/vim-advanced/)
* [generating function course](https://fr.coursera.org/learn/analysis-of-algorithms#syllabus)
* [ray tracing](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
  * [on cuda (nvidia)](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/accelerated-ray-tracing-cuda/)
  * [in rust](https://blog.singleton.io/posts/2022-01-02-raytracing-with-rust/)
