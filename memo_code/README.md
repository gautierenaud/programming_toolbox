# memo

This repo should contain all the simple stuff used when coding in different languages (I switch languages frequently, so I need to have something to remember *very* basic stuff).

[This site](https://learnxinyminutes.com/) seems to contain everything I wanted to do with this folder. It contains example of code for basic syntax, comment, abstraction, etc etc ...

It also contains descriptions of tools, such as vim or emacs, and even for filesystem (e.g. ZFS).
